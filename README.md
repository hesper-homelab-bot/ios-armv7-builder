# ios-armv7-builder

A cross-build kit for **jailbroken 32-bit iOS** (`armv7`, iOS 10.x) that works
entirely **on a Linux host** — no Xcode, no macOS, no Apple SDK, no Apple
signing.

```
Linux host ──(clang+ld64)──▶ Mach-O armv7 ──(ldid)──▶ .deb ──▶ APT repo ──▶ OTA to the device
```

What is inside:

| path | what it is |
|---|---|
| `sysroot-overlay/` | 30 headers that turn musl's Linux-ABI headers into Darwin-ABI ones — the heart of this repo |
| `tools/` | `clang`→`ld64` compiler wrapper and llvm-ar Darwin-archive helpers |
| `tmux/` | flagship build: full **tmux** (3.5a and 3.8 verified on an iPad 4) |
| `tweak/nocablewarn/` | a MobileSubstrate tweak built with the same toolchain |
| `scripts/` | `.deb` packaging and self-hosted APT/Cydia repository publishing |

## Quick start

```sh
export LD64=/path/to/x-ld64/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0-ld
export LD64_LIBS=/path/to/x-libdispatch/lib:/path/to/x-tapi/lib

(cd tmux && TMUX_VERSION=3.8 ./build.sh DEVICE=ipad)   # build tmux
./scripts/make-deb.sh                                  # sign + package
./scripts/make-repo.sh                                 # regenerate the APT repo
git add -A && git commit -m "tmux x.y" && git push     # publish (GitHub Pages)
```

`DEVICE` is an ssh host alias for the device; its ncurses headers and
`libncursesw.5.dylib` are pulled from it during the build.

## Install on the device

BigBoss stopped accepting new packages, so builds publish their own APT
repository (GitHub Pages, from `repo/` in this very repo):

```
https://hesper-homelab-bot.github.io/ios-armv7-builder/repo
```

Add it in Cydia/Sileo, or on the command line as root:

```sh
echo "deb https://hesper-homelab-bot.github.io/ios-armv7-builder/repo stable main" \
    > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ios-tools.list
apt-get update && apt-get install tmux
```

Releases are also on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/hesper-homelab-bot/ios-armv7-builder/releases).

## Why this is not just `./configure && make`

Cross-compiling a POSIX program to old iOS from Linux means fighting four
separate things at once:

1. **No SDK.** There are no iOS headers on a Linux box, so a sysroot has to be
   assembled by hand. This project starts from [musl]'s headers and then
   corrects every place where the Darwin ABI differs.
2. **The Darwin ABI is not the Linux ABI.** Types, structures, signal numbers
   and even the names of `errno` and `stderr` differ. Getting one wrong gives
   you a binary that links but misbehaves at runtime.
3. **`ld64` only reads Darwin archives.** A static library produced by GNU `ar`
   is rejected outright (`archive has no table of contents`).
4. **`configure` lies when the linker is permissive.** Because undefined
   symbols are allowed (they resolve from the device at runtime), every
   `AC_CHECK_FUNCS` probe reports success — including for functions iOS does
   not have.

## The bug that hid them all: `O_NONBLOCK`

Worth reading even if you never build for iOS, because it produced weeks of
blaming the wrong layer.

The sysroot started from musl, whose `fcntl.h` is Linux's:

```
musl/Linux:  O_NONBLOCK = 0x800     (and O_CLOEXEC = 0x80000)
Darwin:      O_NONBLOCK = 0x4       (and O_CLOEXEC = 0x1000000)
```

`fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, 0x800)` on Darwin sets an unrelated bit and *does not set
non-blocking mode* — and fcntl never fails on an unknown flag, so every
"make this socket non-blocking" in the entire program was a **silent no-op**.
Every socket stayed blocking.

Symptoms this one constant produced:

* the client hung forever inside libevent's signal-pipe drain loop
  (`evsig_cb` reads until EAGAIN; on a blocking fd with no data left it simply
  blocks, and the client never called `poll()` again — proven with a watchdog
  and a debug `poll()` wrapper);
* a peer's data sat unread while both processes were alive and sleeping;
* `MSG_EXIT` was queued but the peer never saw it;
* behaviour changed randomly between runs and between the select/kqueue/poll
  backends, because blocking fds make every event-loop race resolve
  differently.

`F_GETFL`/`F_SETFL` (3/4) match Darwin by pure luck, which is why fcntl calls
never failed loudly. `O_CLOEXEC` being wrong also leaked fds into pane
children.

## The rest of the Darwin ABI traps

Each of these produced its own bug before being fixed; the fixes live in
`sysroot-overlay/usr/include/`:

| header | trap |
|---|---|
| `bits/errno.h` | `EAGAIN` 11 (Linux) vs 35 (Darwin): every `errno != EAGAIN` treats "try again" as fatal |
| `sys/socket.h` | `SOL_SOCKET` 1 vs `0xffff`: `sendmsg`+`SCM_RIGHTS` fails with `EINVAL`, so a client cannot hand its tty to a server |
| `fcntl.h` | `O_NONBLOCK`/`O_CLOEXEC` as above |
| `pwd.h` | Darwin inserts `pw_change`/`pw_class`: musl's layout made `pw_shell` read `pw_gecos` — tmux tried to exec a shell named "Mobile User" |
| `termios.h` | musl adds `c_line`; every offset after it differs |
| `sys/utsname.h` | Darwin `char[256]x5` vs musl `char[65]x6`: `uname()` overflows the caller's stack by ~890 bytes and corrupts adjacent buffers (tmux parsed `list-windows` as `liPad3,4`) |
| `bits/signal.h` | signal numbers, `SA_*`, `sigset_t` |
| `sys/ioctl.h` | `TIOCGWINSZ` and friends are completely different ioctls |
| `unistd.h` | `closefrom` does not exist on iOS 10; autoconf probes always succeed because the linker tolerates undefined symbols, so it must be disabled by hand and replaced by the project's bundled copy — it aborts in the forked child of every new pane, visible only in `/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/*.ips` |

Debugging tips that actually worked, in order of usefulness:

1. **Read the crash reports first.** A dyld abort produces no other output;
   `Termination Description: DYLD, Symbol not found: _closefrom` ended days of
   guessing.
2. **Compare the failing program with a minimal one on the device.** A 60-line
   program that performs the same registration pattern either reproduces the
   fault (libevent/platform bug) or passes (program logic bug).
3. **Instrument the platform libraries.** A debug `fprintf` around `poll()`
   showing the fds, requested events and returned `revents` settles arguments
   about "lost wakeups" immediately.

## Credits and licence

The scripts here are provided under the MIT licence. tmux, libevent and musl
keep their own licences. No Apple headers or SDK files are included: the
ncurses headers and the `libncursesw` binary are read from your own device at
build time.
